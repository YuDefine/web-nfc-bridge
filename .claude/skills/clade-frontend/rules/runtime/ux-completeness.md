# Runtime adapter: Claude

Claude has a verified `.claude/hooks/` integration for the one UX gate that still runs automatically: `capabilities/core/hooks/post-edit-ui-qa.sh` fires on every UI edit. The spectra lifecycle gates it used to sit beside (`pre-propose-scan.sh`, `post-propose-check.sh`, `design-inject.sh`, `pre-apply-brief.sh`, `design-gate.sh`, `archive-gate.sh`, `followup-gate.sh`) were retired with the spectra change lifecycle on 2026-09-07; the remaining rows of the base rule are self-checks with no machine behind them. The handoff/model question uses Claude’s `AskUserQuestion` surface.
