# Claude native manual-review operations

Claude Code owns the automated triage and evidence preparation. Use the approved `Agent`/`agent-browser` carrier for self-collection, and use the native question surface only for the shared fallback path that genuinely needs a decision. Claude may write the documented evidence annotations but does not turn visual evidence into user acceptance.

The `claude-discussed` annotation is valid only after the archive walkthrough presented evidence and received an explicit answer. Preserve item kind, checkbox ownership, and conflict-aware writes from the common contract.
