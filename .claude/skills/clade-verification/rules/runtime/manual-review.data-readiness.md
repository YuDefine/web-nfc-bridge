# Claude native data-readiness operations

Claude Code prepares concrete sample identifiers, seed fixtures, URL/role details, and mechanically pollable `ready_signal` values during propose/ingest. The review walkthrough uses the approved `agent-browser`/`Agent` surface only after the shared readiness contract is satisfied.

A sample is not ready because a file or status code exists: the Claude session must observe the requested content and preserve the evidence receipt.
