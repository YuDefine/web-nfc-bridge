# Claude native question escalation

The shared Pi `## Question` protocol stays the carrier contract. Claude's coordinator reads the terminal result, answers only from a cited rule or code fact, and uses `AskUserQuestion` when the question requires a human decision. Re-dispatch preserves the original brief, route, tier basis, and retry receipt.
