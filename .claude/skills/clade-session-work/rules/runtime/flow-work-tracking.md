# Claude native flow telemetry

Claude Code currently supplies the connected `session_summary` collector: `session-start-stalled.sh` invokes `transcript-summary.ts`, which reads the Claude transcript at `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session_id>.jsonl`. Record this as Claude Code evidence only; the transcript `version` field is a Claude Code version. A hook invocation or summary event does not certify another runtime's producer.

For R3, the attended-session consumer is the configured `session-start-stalled.sh` entry, which runs `flow status --stalled` and carries the receipt into the session. The Claude projection carries this source's loading path for `vendor/scripts/flow/**`; the common rule remains the source of the orphan threshold and warning semantics.
