# Claude skill delivery

Clade plugin skills render to `.claude/skills/<name>/`; commands and agents use their own Claude native directories. These generated files retain source/hash ownership. Existing consumer-owned or third-party files in that directory remain their recorded source until an explicit, recoverable adoption; a shared directory name does not authorize overwrite.

For the existing third-party installation workflow, use its recorded `npx skills add --agent claude-code --copy` invocation and source/version, preserve the skill contents and `skills-lock.json`, and verify from a fresh setup. This legacy install command does not install Codex skills. Claude skill discovery and invocation must be checked in the actual target product; the projection receipt alone does not prove loading.
