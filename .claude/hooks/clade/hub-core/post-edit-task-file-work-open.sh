# PostToolUse hook: Edit|Write → a new `tasks/<date>-<slug>.md` must have a named work item.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `rules/core/session-tasks.operations.md` § 建檔的同一步順路鑄 work id already
# says MUST, and says it precisely (`flow open <slug> --origin tasks:<path> --title '<一句話>'`).
# It was not being followed: measured 2026-08-29 across 12 consumer repos, 350 work items carried
# 0 titles and 0 origins. A MUST with no mechanical backstop is a MUST that fires only when
# somebody happens to have read it — and the moment it must fire (creating the file) is exactly
# the moment nobody is reading rules.
#
# So this is a BACKSTOP, not new policy: it prints the command the rule already specifies, filled
# in with this file's own path and slug, at the instant the file appears.
#
# warn-only, and MUST stay warn-only. Blocking a task-file write to collect telemetry inverts the
# priority the whole spine is built on — the work outranks the record of the work (emit's contract
# is fail-open everywhere for the same reason). A blocked write would also arrive as an error on
# the one action a session takes when it is trying to be disciplined.
#
# It does NOT mint anything itself. Minting needs a `--title` that says what the work is, and only
# the agent that just wrote the file knows that; a hook-generated title would be the slug again,
# which is the exact failure being fixed (a name that names nothing).

[work-open] $REL 還沒有具名的 work item —— 它會在 /board 上顯示為 orphan、在 /overview 上完全不出現。

--title 要寫「要解決什麼問題」，NEVER 把 slug 重寫一遍——一個只是把檔名再說一次的 title，
對讀的人與沒有 title 完全等價。跑完把印出的 export CLADE_WORK_ID=… 帶進本 session。
鑄名 fail-open：這條指令失敗 NEVER 擋你繼續做事。
