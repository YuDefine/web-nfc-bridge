# PreToolUse:Bash hook — provenance gate on `git push` to origin/main
#
# Blocks pushes to origin/main (or origin/master) when new commits lack
# /commit provenance (`Via: /commit` trailer) AND are substantive
# (>5 files changed, touching code files).
#
# Ad-hoc commits (≤5 files, or doc/config-only) pass without provenance.
# Fail-open on errors — avoids blocking normal push when infra breaks.

  # Native delivery (`.claude/hooks/clade/hub-core/`) has no CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, so the clade

⛔ Push blocked: substantive commits without /commit provenance

The following commits change >5 files (including code) but lack the
\`Via: /commit\` trailer, meaning they bypassed /commit's 0-A cross-model
review gate:

$(printf '%b' "$blocked_commits")
${baseline_note}
Fix: run \`/commit\` (or hand the work to \`wt\` to open a clean worktree and run /commit inside it).
The \`Via: /commit\` trailer is added automatically by /commit Step 4/5.

Ad-hoc commits (≤5 files or doc-only) do not need /commit provenance.
See rules/core/commit.md § 隔離 worktree ≠ 繞過 /commit.

If the commits above are pre-existing history nobody is going to rewrite
(authored before this gate, or owned by another session), a line can be drawn
under them — but only on a human's explicit say-so, never on an agent's own
judgement that the gate is inconvenient:

  git update-ref refs/clade/provenance-baseline <sha>

Commits at or before <sha> are then treated as accepted history; everything
after it is still judged. Pick the newest commit you are accepting, never
HEAD itself — that would forgive the very commit you are pushing.
